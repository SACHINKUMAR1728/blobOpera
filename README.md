# MoveBlobOpera

This is a fun little project that lets you use your hand to control a webpage, and the star of the show is the Blob Opera. It's like magic, but with code!

## What's Inside?

- **OpenCV (cv2):** This helps us grab video from your webcam and work with it.

- **MediaPipe:** It tracks your hand and turns it into a virtual mouse.

- **PyAutoGUI:** This lets you simulate mouse clicks and movements.

- **Selenium:** It's used to open a webpage and control it.

## About the Blob Opera

The Blob Opera is a fantastic web experiment by Google Arts & Culture. It lets you create music with adorable singing blobs! You can find it [here](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/blob-opera/AAHWrq360NcGbw?hl=en).

## How to Try It

1. Clone this code to your computer.

2. Make sure you have Python and some libraries installed.

   run this command "pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui selenium webdriver-manager"

3. Run the script.

4. Your webcam feed will open, and your hand will control the webpage.

## Play Around

- Move your hand to control the cursor.
- It clicks when your hand is low and stops clicking when it's high.
- The horizontal hand position controls where it clicks.

## Customization

You can change the webpage and how your hand works by tweaking the code.
